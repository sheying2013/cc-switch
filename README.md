## Why CC Switch?

AI coding tools like Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI each have their own configuration format. Switching API providers means hand-editing JSON, TOML, YAML, or `.env` files.

**CC Switch** brings all of this into a single desktop app: pick a preset, enter your key, and switch in one click, without losing your existing configuration.

- **One App, Ten Tools** — Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, Gemini CLI, Grok Build, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Hermes, Pi, and MiniMax Code
- **No More Manual Editing** — 90+ provider presets including AWS Bedrock, NVIDIA NIM, and community relays
- **Use GPT in Claude Code, Claude in Codex** — Built-in local routing automatically converts between Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini API formats, with automatic failover
- **Usage & Quotas at a Glance** — Track token usage and spending even without local routing; subscription quotas and balances show right on provider cards and in the tray
- **Cross-Platform** — Native desktop app for Windows, macOS, and Linux, built with Tauri 2

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

1. **Add Provider**: Click "Add New Provider" (the + button) in the toolbar → Choose a preset or create a custom configuration
2. **Switch Provider**:
   - Main UI: Select provider → Click "Enable" (for OpenCode, OpenClaw, Hermes, and MiniMax Code the button is "Add"; these four tools and Pi are coexist-mode tools, so you can add several providers at once)
   - System Tray: Click provider name directly (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and Grok Build only)
3. **Takes Effect**: Claude Code needs no restart; for Codex, Gemini CLI, and Grok Build, restart your terminal or the CLI tool; for Claude Desktop, restart the app itself (see FAQ)
4. **Back to Official Login**: Switch to the built-in official provider in the list (e.g. "Claude Official"), restart the tool, then follow its login/OAuth flow
5. **Local Routing (optional)**: To use OpenAI- or Gemini-format providers in Claude Code, or to use Claude in Codex, you need to turn on local routing. In "Settings → Routing → Local Routing", turn on "Routing Master Switch", then turn on the tool you need under "Routing Enabled". To toggle it right from the top of the main page, turn on "Show Routing Toggle on Main Page"

### Projects & Sessions

- **Projects**: On the Claude Code, Claude Desktop, or Codex page, open the project switcher at the top of the main page → "New project" to save the current configuration; later, pick it from the switcher to switch the whole setup at once
- **Sessions**: Click "Session Manager" → Browse, search, and restore each tool's conversation history

> **Note**: On first launch, CC Switch automatically imports your existing Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and Grok Build configuration as a provider named `default` and adds an official provider for each of these tools and Claude Desktop, so nothing you had configured is lost.

## Features

[Full Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) | [Release Notes](docs/release-notes/v3.20.4-en.md)

### Supported Features by Tool

| Tool | Providers | Local Routing | Tray Switching | Sessions | Usage Stats |
| --- | --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Claude Code | Switch | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Claude Desktop | Switch | Model Mapping only | – | – | Model Mapping only |
| Codex | Switch | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Gemini CLI | Switch | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Grok Build | Switch | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| OpenCode | Coexist | – | – | ✓ | ✓ |
| OpenClaw | Coexist | – | – | ✓ | – |
| Hermes | Coexist | – | – | ✓ | – |
| Pi | Coexist | – | – | ✓ | ✓ |
| MiniMax Code | Coexist | – | – | ✓ | ✓ |

- **Switch**: only one provider is active at a time; **Coexist**: multiple providers are written into the tool's own config at the same time, and you pick one inside the tool.
- **Local Routing**: CC Switch forwards requests on your machine and converts API formats; see [Local Routing & Failover](#local-routing--failover) below. Claude Desktop providers can use "Direct" or "Model Mapping"; with "Model Mapping", requests go through local routing.
- **Sessions**: Browse and search conversation history, and copy a resume command to continue a conversation (resuming OpenClaw and Hermes sessions isn't supported yet). To view Hermes sessions, select "All" in the Session Manager.
- **Usage Stats**: Without local routing, usage is collected from each tool's local session logs; requests that go through local routing are counted as well.

### Provider Management

- **90+ provider presets** — Pick a preset and enter your key to add a provider, or create a custom configuration
- **Key fields only** — Switching replaces only the connection details such as the endpoint, key, and model; plugins, hooks, MCP, settings you added yourself, and comments stay as they are
- **Projects** — Save Claude Code's or Codex's current provider as a project (for Claude Desktop, only the provider is saved), then switch the whole setup in one click from the project switcher at the top of the main page or from the tray; when you switch to another project, the current state is automatically saved back to the previous project
- **Third-party providers for Claude Desktop** — Connect directly to Anthropic-compatible endpoints; for non-Claude models, choose "Model Mapping" to map tiers like Sonnet, Opus, and Haiku to the provider's actual models through local routing
- **Universal providers** — One config syncs to Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI
- One-click switching, system tray quick switching (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Grok Build), drag-and-drop sorting, import/export

### Local Routing & Failover

- **API format conversion** — Local routing converts requests between Anthropic Messages, OpenAI Chat Completions, OpenAI Responses, and Gemini Native: Claude Code and Claude Desktop can use OpenAI- or Gemini-format providers, and Codex and Grok Build can use Chat Completions or Anthropic Messages providers
- **Per-tool toggle** — Local routing can be turned on separately for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and Grok Build; once it's on, switching providers takes effect immediately for subsequent requests (Codex, Gemini CLI, and Grok Build may still need a restart if the switch changes the model)
- **Auto-failover** — Configure a failover queue for each tool; when a request fails, CC Switch automatically moves on to the next provider in the queue, backed by a circuit breaker and provider health monitoring
- **Rectifier** — Automatically fixes certain requests that some upstreams can't handle (e.g. Thinking signatures, or falling back when images aren't supported)
- Official providers (e.g. Claude Official) can't go through local routing (except Codex's OpenAI Official)
- Guides: [Using GPT in Claude Code](docs/guides/claude-codex-routing-guide-en.md) · [Using Claude in Codex](docs/guides/codex-claude-routing-guide-en.md)

### Usage & Cost Tracking

- **Usage dashboard** — Works without local routing: by default it automatically scans each tool's local session logs and tracks requests, tokens, cache hit rate, and spending by provider and model, with trend charts and per-request logs
- **Quotas & balances** — Provider cards and the tray show official subscription quotas (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, SuperGrok), Coding Plan 5-hour / weekly / monthly quotas (Kimi, Zhipu GLM, MiniMax, Volcengine Ark, etc.), and account balances (DeepSeek, OpenRouter, SiliconFlow, etc.); some need to be turned on first via "Configure usage query" on the provider card, and for other providers you can write a custom usage script
- **Custom pricing** — Set per-model prices, or import them from models.dev

### Session Manager & Workspace

- **Session Manager** — Browse and search each tool's conversation history, and copy a resume command to continue a conversation; on macOS you can resume in a terminal with one click
- **Workspace editor** (OpenClaw) — Edit agent files (AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, etc.) and daily memory
- **Memory** (Hermes) — Edit Hermes's MEMORY.md and USER.md

### System & Platform

- **Cloud sync** — Sync across devices via WebDAV (Jianguoyun, Nextcloud, Synology NAS, etc.) or S3-compatible storage (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Alibaba Cloud OSS, Tencent Cloud COS, etc.); you can also put the CC Switch configuration directory in a cloud drive folder such as Dropbox, OneDrive, or iCloud
- **CLI tool management** — On the "About" page, see the current and latest versions of command-line tools like Claude Code and Codex, install, upgrade, or upgrade all in one click, and diagnose duplicate installations; on Windows it can also manage tools inside WSL (see FAQ)
- **Deep Link** (`ccswitch://`) — Import providers in one click via a link
- **Built-in utilities** — Skip Claude Code's first-run confirmation, hide AI attribution, have the VS Code Claude Code extension follow CC Switch's provider switches, and more
- Dark / Light / System theme, auto-launch, auto-updater, atomic writes, auto-backups, i18n (zh/zh-TW/en/ja)

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Which AI tools does CC Switch support?</strong></summary>

CC Switch supports ten tools: **Claude Code**, **Claude Desktop**, **Codex**, **Gemini CLI**, **Grok Build**, **OpenCode**, **OpenClaw**, **Hermes**, **Pi**, **MiniMax Code**. Each tool has dedicated provider presets and configuration management; see [Supported Features by Tool](#supported-features-by-tool) for what each one supports.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need to restart the terminal after switching providers?</strong></summary>

It depends on the tool:

- **Claude Code**: supports hot-switching of provider data — no restart needed.
- **Codex, Gemini CLI, Grok Build**: restart your terminal or the CLI tool for changes to take effect (CC Switch reminds you after switching). With local routing on, requests go to the new provider immediately, but all three tools may still need a restart if the switch changes the model.
- **Claude Desktop**: fully quit and reopen Claude Desktop; when using "Model Mapping", also keep CC Switch running.
- **OpenCode, OpenClaw, Hermes, Pi, MiniMax Code**: these are coexist-mode tools — clicking "Add" ("Enable" for Pi) writes the provider into the tool's own config alongside the others; you then pick the model you want inside the tool.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Will switching providers change my plugins, hooks, or other settings?</strong></summary>

No. When you switch providers for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, or Grok Build, CC Switch replaces only the **key fields** in the config file: the endpoint, key, model name, and API protocol (plus the reasoning effort for Codex and the auth method for Gemini CLI), along with a few compatibility options that belong to the provider (such as Claude Code's "Disable Artifact Tool" and the context window). Plugins, hooks, permissions, MCP, environment variables you added yourself, comments, and formatting all stay as they are and apply to every provider.

You can change these shared settings in the tool itself or by editing the config file by hand. You can also edit any provider in CC Switch: the editor shows "what the config file will look like after switching to this provider". When you save, the key fields are stored in that provider, and every other change is written to the config file and applies to every provider.

So the old "Common Config Snippet" is no longer needed, and its buttons have been removed. Settings that were in your snippet before the upgrade were already written into the config file when you switched, so they stay. Before CC Switch rewrites each config file for the first time, it also backs up the original to `~/.cc-switch/backups/live-first-write/`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>I changed the model inside the tool — why does it go back after I switch away and back?</strong></summary>

The model is a key field and belongs to the provider. A model you pick inside the tool (such as with `/model` in Claude Code) stays in effect until the next switch; when you switch, the model in the config file is replaced with the one saved in the target provider, and CC Switch doesn't save the model you picked back to the previous provider. To keep using a model long-term, edit that provider in CC Switch.

Older versions saved the whole config file back to the provider when you switched away. That no longer happens: it froze plugins and other shared settings into one provider, so they were lost when you switched to another one.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why can't I delete the currently active provider?</strong></summary>

CC Switch follows a "minimal intrusion" design principle — even if you uninstall the app, your tools will continue to work normally.

So for tools that use one active provider at a time (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, Gemini CLI, Grok Build), the system always keeps one active configuration, because deleting all configurations would make the corresponding tool unusable. Coexist-mode tools (OpenCode, OpenClaw, Hermes, Pi, and MiniMax Code) aren't subject to this restriction — you can delete any provider directly. If you rarely use a tool, you can hide it in Settings. To switch back to official login, see the next question.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I switch back to official login?</strong></summary>

In CC Switch, the provider lists for Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, Gemini CLI, and Grok Build each include a built-in official provider (**Claude Official**, **Claude Desktop Official**, **OpenAI Official**, **Google Official**, **Grok Official**); if you deleted it, add it back from the presets. After switching to the official provider, follow the tool's own login flow (e.g. `/login` in Claude Code, `codex login` for Codex), and then you can freely switch between the official provider and third-party providers.

For Codex, you can also sign in to multiple ChatGPT accounts inside CC Switch via "Sign in with ChatGPT" and choose an "Account to use" for each **OpenAI Official** card, so switching between multiple Plus, Pro, or Team accounts takes one click; cards set to "Follow Codex login" keep using the Codex CLI's own login.

Note: official providers can't be selected while local routing is on — Codex's OpenAI Official cards are the exception.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>With local routing on, why does my config file point to 127.0.0.1?</strong></summary>

With local routing on, the tool's requests first go to CC Switch's local routing (`http://127.0.0.1:15721` by default), and CC Switch then forwards them to the provider you selected. That's why the tool's config file only contains the local address and the placeholder key `PROXY_MANAGED`; for Claude Code, the model name is also written as a fixed alias such as `claude-sonnet-5` (the `/model` menu still shows the real model name). The real provider address, key, and model are all stored in CC Switch.

In "Settings → Usage Statistics → Request Logs" you can see "requested model → actual model" for each request.

While local routing is on, switching changes the provider that local routing uses; the provider you were using before you turned it on stays the same and is labeled "Direct" on its card. When you turn local routing off, the config file is written back to this direct provider's configuration. Quitting CC Switch also writes back the direct provider first, and local routing is reconnected the next time CC Switch starts.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use OpenAI-compatible APIs, Gemini, or local models in Claude Code?</strong></summary>

Yes, but you need to turn on local routing. When editing the provider, set "Upstream Format" under "Advanced Options" to match the provider's API: choose "OpenAI Chat Completions" for services that only offer a Chat Completions endpoint (as many local model servers do), "OpenAI Responses API" for services that offer a Responses endpoint, and "Gemini Native generateContent" for Gemini. Then turn on local routing for Claude Code as described in step 5 of [Quick Start](#quick-start). Choosing the wrong format or not turning on local routing usually results in a 404 or 405 error.

Conversely, choosing "Anthropic Messages" as the "Upstream Format" in Codex or Grok Build lets you use Claude-format providers; this also requires local routing. See [Using GPT in Claude Code](docs/guides/claude-codex-routing-guide-en.md) and [Using Claude in Codex](docs/guides/codex-claude-routing-guide-en.md) for details.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"Connectivity check" passed, so why do requests still fail?</strong></summary>

The "Connectivity check" on a provider card only checks whether the provider address is reachable; it doesn't send a real model request, so it can't verify whether the API key and model name are correct. When requests fail, check the key, model name, and upstream format; with local routing on, you can also see the exact error in "Settings → Usage Statistics → Request Logs".

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Where is my data stored?</strong></summary>

By default, everything is stored in the `.cc-switch` folder in your home directory (`C:\Users\<user>\.cc-switch` on Windows):

- **Database**: `cc-switch.db` (SQLite — providers, projects, usage records, etc.)
- **Local settings**: `settings.json` (device-level settings such as each tool's config directory, backup policy, and cloud sync connection details)
- **Backups**: `backups/` (backed up automatically every 24 hours by default, keeping the 10 most recent; adjustable in "Settings → Advanced → Backup & Restore")
- **Skill Backups**: `skill-backups/` (created automatically before uninstalling or updating a skill, keeping the 20 most recent)
- **OAuth login credentials**: `copilot_auth.json`, `codex_oauth_auth.json`, `xai_oauth_auth.json`
- **Logs**: `logs/cc-switch.log` and `crash.log` — please attach them when reporting an issue
- **Device state**: `live-state.json` (whether each tool is connected directly or through local routing, and what was last written), `codex-login-stash.json` (the official Codex login moved aside when you switch to a third-party provider, restored when you switch back to an official one)
- **Original config files**: `backups/live-first-write/` (each tool's config file as it was before CC Switch first rewrote it)

After you change "CC Switch Configuration Directory" in "Settings → Advanced → Configuration Directory", all of the files above except `settings.json`, the device state, and the original config files are stored in the new directory. CC Switch doesn't move existing files automatically, so copy them over manually first. `settings.json`, the device state, and the original config files belong to this computer only: they always stay in the default directory and are not included in cloud sync.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I manage tools inside WSL on Windows?</strong></summary>

CC Switch doesn't detect WSL automatically. In "Settings → Advanced → Configuration Directory → Configuration Directory Override (Advanced)", change the directory for the corresponding tool to a path inside WSL, e.g. `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\<user>\.claude`; after you save, CC Switch reads and writes the config inside WSL (supported for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Grok Build, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Hermes, and Pi). Once this is set, the "About" page also detects and upgrades that tool in the corresponding WSL distribution.

Note: local routing writes `127.0.0.1` as the address into the config. In WSL2's default NAT networking mode, `127.0.0.1` inside WSL can't reach local routing on Windows; switch WSL to mirrored networking mode instead.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is there a command-line or headless version?</strong></summary>

CC Switch itself only ships as a desktop app that requires a graphical interface (see [Download & Installation](#download--installation) for system requirements). For servers, SSH sessions, or machines without a desktop environment, we recommend the community-maintained **[CC Switch CLI](https://github.com/SaladDay/cc-switch-cli)**: it offers both an interactive terminal UI (TUI) and a command-line mode, supports Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Hermes, and Pi, and can be installed via Homebrew (`brew install cc-switch-cli`) or an install script.

By default, CC Switch CLI shares the `~/.cc-switch` data directory with the desktop app and is compatible with the desktop app's WebDAV sync. The two projects are released separately, and the database version the CLI supports sometimes lags behind the desktop app; if you see a "database version is too new" message, upgrade the CLI or wait for it to catch up.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Linux (Wayland + NVIDIA): clicks don't register and the window black-screens on resize</strong></summary>

The AppImage forces `GDK_BACKEND=x11` (XWayland) to avoid a historical native-Wayland crash. On newer Wayland + NVIDIA setups this can leave the web content area unclickable (the title-bar buttons still work) and black-screen on resize. Launch with the opt-in escape hatch to switch back to native Wayland:

```bash
CC_SWITCH_GDK_BACKEND=wayland ./CC-Switch-*.AppImage
```

If you launch from a desktop icon, add it to the `.desktop` `Exec=` line (e.g. `env CC_SWITCH_GDK_BACKEND=wayland /path/to/AppImage`) or set it in your session environment. The variable is generic: on tiling Wayland compositors (sway/Hyprland) where clicks don't register, try `CC_SWITCH_GDK_BACKEND=x11` instead. Leaving it unset keeps the default behavior.
